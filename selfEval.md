# Self Evaluation

- Reflect on your time management and awareness of where you spend time. Is this a strength or area you are working on? What support do you need in this area? And/or, what tips do you have to share with your classmates in this area?
I have struggled with time management the last couple days because I cannot judge how long the assignments will take. I expect that after I am fully in the groove that this will no longer be an issue.
- How would you explain to a 5 year old what a function is?
I would tell them to think of it as a list of rules for a game, and the program is the game they are playing.
- Share your understanding of arguments and parameters.
A paraameter works like a variable. it can be accessed inside a function. Arguments are the data. They must be provided. These are written in JavaScript and are composed of strings, numbers, and booleans.
- What questions/topics (related to Functions) do you want to being to your Small Group?
How can some functions act to disengage other functions? Do they conflict?
